# Introduction

Bitcount is created from an older, personal project that I made to keep track of the data that was being used over a metered connection. While Windows has several options for accomplishing this task, I found many of the Linux options lacking. In addition, many of those options were specific to one particular desktop environment and not available to others.

    * Alternately, display the current usage since reset.
